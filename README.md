
# Introduction:

I built a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React & Node.js) Stack website as part of my final project at General Assembly. 

# Technologies used:

* React Swipe
* React JS
* Babel
* Webpack
* Sass
* React Slick
* React bootstrap
* MongoDB
* Express 
* React router dom

# Concept:

For this Project, I decided to challenge myself and build a React tinder swipe app. The app allows you to sign petitions with a swipe to the right and skip petitions by swiping to the left. I wanted to replace the need to fill in your personal details each time you sign a petition. I was thinking on the customer experience side first and then think back towards the technology. I managed this project using the agile management skills I have learnt in my group project and by building this with React.js I was able to further my understanding in this technology.

The inspiration of my idea comes from the United Nations. In 2015 they have launched 17 sustainable development goals. These goals aim to take on the environmental and social challenges we are facing in the world. The app allows the user to filter and select the goals related petitions so that they can also participate in the goals by taking their government into account with their policies. 

My MVP was to build a RESTful authenication app. I was able to reach this and have spare time to implement the search bar which is not part of the MVP. 

The following logic was implemented for my app: 

* Allow you to swipe left to skip and swipe right to sign the petitions. 

* The petitions won’t show up twice. You will only see the petition that you haven’t signed for. 

* You can only see the Petition that hasn’t expired yet. 

* Allow you to click on user profile page and see all petitions that belong to that user. 

* Categorize and find petitions related to the goals you care about. 

Here is the 17 Sustainable Development Goals.  

1)you can filter the search by selecting the goals you care the most. 

2) As a result you will only see the petitions related to the goals you have chosen. 

3) Before you swipe the petition you could click on "read more" to learn more about the petition before signing or skipping. 



# My approach:

Initial ideation and feature brainstorming:

I drew basic wireframe of what it might look like and the functionalities of the app. I was interviewing potential users for feedback. 
After receiving feedback I added the login, register and logout in the centre of the image. I added a tutorial to teach people how to use the app and headings/subheading for easy navigation. I added the carousel in the user profile page to the design as I thought it would be more user friendly on mobile which I have implemented on the actual app. For the final design I have added a user feedback page but I didn't have enough time to implement this part of the design. 

After I have built my prototype with styling, I did some more interview on the user experience. I recieved the following feedback from the users: 

* have a universal back button.
* add spacing to the texts in the welcome page.
* required field for password /login.
* add borders to the petitions. 
* use the same colour for all buttons for consistency.

# Final thoughts:
Overall I am happy that I have my MVP and have implemented all the core features of the app.
